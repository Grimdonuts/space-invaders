# space-invaders

A challenge I issued myself... Command-line compiler, text editor, and hand drawn graphics. No other major tools were allowed to be used aside from SDL2.
A space invaders semi-clone based on assumptions of how it works. Mostly from scratch using SDL2.
This does not include a menu, a scoreboard, or sound, but it is playable.

Can be compiled and debugged in VSCode. Be sure to have MinGW installed, current setting is pointing at the C://MinGW// .
